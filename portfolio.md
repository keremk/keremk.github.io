### [Coloring Fun - iOS App](/portfolio/coloringfun/)

A simple coloring game for kids. Launched in 2009, as my first app to learn iOS programming. Hit the #2 spot in UK in the games category and #43 in the overall games category. It was also #3 in France, #5 in Italy, #7 in Canada, #7 in Australia and #17 in Germany.
