After over 4 years of not blogging, this Christmas holiday, I decided to give it another shot. This time, I will try to make a [habit](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business-ebook/dp/B0055PGUYU) of it and will track my blogging frequency using a pretty cool app called [Lift](https://lift.do/). 

So what am I planning to blog about?

* Tech tips and tricks: Favorite tools, frameworks, learning new languages...
* Programming journal: If I spent time on learning something, I will try to document what I learned here. My programming interests are in Ruby, ObjectiveC (iOS development), Python (Data Science), Scala (just starting to learn...)
* Opinions on software development ...
* Startup life...
* Lifehacks...     

I changed my blogging engine and hosting providers from Wordpress and Dreamhost to static HTML based [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). More on that in my upcoming post on [Switching to Github Pages]()...

So since I changed my blogging platform, the question was what to do with my old posts. Most of them are rather old and not relevant anymore so I dropped them off as I migrated. However I am going to include one of my posts that is still getting some sizeable traffic with a quick updated set of links to read the a more up-to-date approach.
